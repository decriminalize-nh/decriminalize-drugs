THE DRUG DECRIMINALIZATION ACT

Whereas, drug prohibition has not only failed to keep drugs off the streets and prevent the harms caused by drug abuse, but prohibition has actually made society worse off by empowering an entire criminal class fueled by lucrative profits from the illicit drug trade.

Whereas, despite the efforts of law enforcement to make a dent in the drug trade, in the decades since President Richard Nixon declared "War on Drugs", average prices of illicit drugs have fallen while the production, purity, and strength of illicit drugs have all increased.

Whereas, criminalizing drugs leads to concentrated, more lethal drugs which are easier to hide and conceal, leading to overdose deaths and hospitalizations.

Whereas, in 2019, Four hundred fifteen (415) New Hampshirites died because of drug overdoses, more than one person per day.

Whereas, New Hampshirites suffering from substance use disorder also need adequate access to peer support and stable housing. It's estimated that in 2018 there were 96,000 people who needed but did not receive substance abuse treatment. Drug addiction exacerbates many of our stateâ€™s most pressing problems, such as homelessness and poverty, and treatment can help people escape the trap of addiction. One of the biggest barriers to people getting the treatment they need is fear and stigma created by prohibition.

Whereas, New Hampshire needs to shift its focus to address the problem of drug abuse using a humane, cost-effective, health-based approach. People suffering from addiction are more effectively treated with health care services than with criminal punishments. A health care approach includes a health assessment to figure out the needs of people who are suffering from addiction, and it includes connecting them to the services they need.

Whereas, New Hampshire still treats addiction as a criminal problem. Law enforcement should spend more time on community safety, but in 2016 New Hampshire convicted more than 6200 people of drug-related offenses. In many instances, the same people were arrested for drug possession, again and again, because they were unable to get treatment.

Whereas, punishing people who are suffering from addiction ruins lives. Criminalizing drugs saddles people with criminal records and tears families and communities apart. Criminal records from drug offenses prevent people from getting housing, going to school, getting loans, getting professional licenses, getting jobs and keeping jobs. Criminalizing drugs disproportionately harms poor people and racial minorities.

Whereas, punishing people who are suffering from addiction is expensive. It costs the criminal justice system in New Hampshire over $180 million per year to enforce drug prohibition.

Whereas, households have been economically devastated by drug prohibition, with parents, guardians, children, and roommates taken away by the criminal justice system, leaving households saddled with legal bills and debt and one less helping hand. Even after someone is released from jail or prison, their household remains negatively affected by prohibition due to the reduced earning potential of someone with a criminal record.

The People of New Hampshire therefore propose this Drug Decriminalization Act of 2020 to end drug prohibition in New Hampshire, shift to treating drug addiction and abuse as health issues rather than criminal issues, and remove a large part of the drug manufacturing and distribution businesses from the exclusive control of black market criminals.

FINDINGS AND POLICY

Section 1. (1)(a) The people of New Hampshire find that a health-based approach to addiction and overdose is more effective, humane, and cost-effective than criminal punishments. Making people criminals because they suffer from addiction is expensive, ruins lives, and can make access to treatment and recovery more difficult.

(b) The people of New Hampshire further find that drug prohibition has failed to keep drugs off the streets. As long as there is demand, there will be an incentive for someone to produce a supply of drugs to meet demand. The profitability of the illicit drug trade has empowered multinational criminal organizations that have wreaked extreme terror and violence on the communities where they establish their businesses. In contrast, such horrors are virtually unheard of in markets such as agriculture, finance, and other legal trades. Decriminalizing drug manufacturing and distribution would enable law-abiding businesses and non-profits to produce a safer and more socially responsible supply of drugs to meet market demand.

(2) The purpose of this Drug Decriminalization Act of 2020 is to adopt a health approach to drug addiction by removing criminal penalties for drug possession, and to enable law-abiding businesses and non-profits to produce a safer supply of drugs by removing criminal penalties for drug manufacturing and distribution.

(3) The provisions of this Act shall be interpreted consistently with the findings, purposes, and policy objectives stated in this section and shall not be limited by any policy set forth in New Hampshire law that could conflict with or be interpreted to conflict with the purposes and policy objectives stated in this section.

STATUTES AMENDED AND REPEALED

Section 2. (1) RSA 172:13 is amended to read as follows:

I. Any resident of the state, or the parent, person in loco parentis, or the legal guardian of a resident under 18 years of age or mentally incompetent, may apply to the commissioner for voluntary admission of such resident for care, treatment and guidance. The commissioner may adopt such rules regarding the admission, care and treatment of voluntary patients as he deems best. The rules of the commissioner in regard to voluntary clients shall be printed and made available to the public. No voluntary client shall, by asking the help or care of the commissioner, abridge any of his civil rights nor shall evidence of his voluntary submission to the commissioner's care and control be admissible against him in any court. All records pertaining to voluntary clients shall be kept confidential and not divulged, except that the commissioner may release such records to hospitals, institutions and physicians whenever in his discretion such information may assist in further treatment of the voluntary client.  
II. When a person is indicted for any felony or is awaiting the action of the grand jury on any felony, or is charged with a misdemeanor, and question as to the drug or alcohol dependency of the person is raised by either party, any justice of the superior or circuit court having jurisdiction over the matter may, after hearing, order such person to be examined in accordance with the instructions of the commissioner to determine whether said person is drug or alcohol dependent. The commissioner shall report the results of the examination and his findings to the court in writing.  
III. If a person examined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph II is found to be drug or alcohol dependent, the superior court having jurisdiction over the criminal action may, after hearing, without regard to the result of the criminal action, issue an order requiring the person to accept treatment at a certified substance abuse treatment facility when an opening becomes available. During treatment no further action shall be taken in respect to the original charges made against such a person unless otherwise ordered by the court. The court may release the person conditionally for treatment at any alcohol-drug abuse clinic, certified facility, mental health clinic or center or other appropriate sources of care.  
IV. Nothing in this section shall prevent the court from placing a person convicted of a violation of RSA 318-B on probation conditioned upon the requirement that the person receive treatment at a treatment facility such as a certified substance abuse facility or other alcohol-drug abuse clinic, mental health clinic or center, or other appropriate sources of care.

(2) The following statutes are repealed:

RSA 126-X

RSA 318-B

RSA 318-C

RSA 490-G

RSA 265-A

CLEAN SLATE

Section 3. (1) Anyone currently in jail awaiting trial or serving a prison sentence for a violation of any of the statutes amended or repealed by this Act shall be immediately pardoned and released. For anyone serving consecutive sentences due to a conviction of a crime repealed by this Act, the time added by the conviction in question shall be deducted from their remaining sentence.

(2) Any and all prior record of charges for crimes repealed by this Act shall be immediately and permanently expunged from the criminal record.

DRUG WAR JUSTICE FUND

Section 4. (1) The people of New Hampshire recognize that drug prohibition has had long-lasting negative impacts on affected communities, leading to a significant financial burden borne by arrestees, convicts, and their families.

(2) The exact financial cost to victims of drug prohibition is logistically difficult to the point of being practically impossible to quantify in exact amounts. We cannot know what opportunities have been lost due to an arrest or conviction. Still, we cannot allow this difficulty to stop us from attempting to right the wrongs that victims of drug prohibition have suffered.

(3) The people of New Hampshire desire to provide some justice to the victims of drug prohibition by providing direct cash compensation through a new fund, the Drug War Justice Fund, in hopes that this money will help them rebuild their lives and give them hope for a better future in a post-prohibition world.

(4) Money for the Fund will come from the savings to New Hampshire taxpayers by ending drug prohibition, which has been estimated to be over $180 million per year.

(5) Money allocated to the Fund shall be distributed as follows:

(a) 90% of the Fund shall be used to provide direct cash payments either (i) to anyone previously convicted as an adult, or adjudicated as a minor, prior to November 1, 2020, for any crime repealed by this Act, or (ii) to their next of kin if the arrestee/convict/adjudicated minor has passed away within the last fifty years, or (iii) to their legal guardian if they are otherwise unable to accept the payment directly.

(b) The remaining 10% of the Fund shall be used to provide direct cash payments to any law enforcement officers who have been physically or emotionally harmed in the line of duty while enforcing any of the statutes repealed by this Act.

(c) Proof of eligibility must be submitted along with any claims requests, and these proofs must be verified by the government before money from the Fund is distributed for this cause. If the claim is not verified or denied within 90 days of receipt, the claim shall automatically be approved and funds paid retroactive to the initial date of the claim.

(c) Funding shall be divided equally between all claimants each annual period, and there shall be a cap on funding going to each recipient of $74,991 per year (the 2018 median income in New Hampshire). Once enrolled as a claimant, payments from the Fund shall continue automatically until the end of the program. It is the responsibility of each claimant to update their payment details with the relevant government department if any update is needed.

(d) Any money leftover at the end of the Fund's five year term will be transferred to the General Fund.

Section 5. (1) The Drug War Justice Fund is established in the State Treasury, separate and distinct from the General Fund. Interest earned by the Fund shall be credited to the Fund.

(2) The Drug War Justice Fund shall consist of:

(a) Moneys deposited into the Fund pursuant to section 6;

(b) Moneys appropriated or otherwise transferred to the fund by the Legislative Assembly;

(c) All other moneys deposited in the fund from any source.

(4) Unexpended moneys in the Fund may not lapse and shall be carried forward and may be used without regard to fiscal year, except as provided by section 4(5)(d).

Section 6. (1) The Department of Revenue Administration shall credit and transfer or cause to be credited and transferred to the Drug War Justice Fund the savings to the State of New Hampshire from the implementation of this Act as calculated in section 7.

(2) If the savings calculated for any subsequent year under section 7(1) is less than any prior year, the amount credited and transferred to the Drug War Justice Fund shall be the highest amount calculated for any previous year.

(3) The savings as calculated in section 7 shall be transferred on or before the end of the fiscal year in which the calculation is completed.

Section 7. (1)(a) Within 180 days of the end of the first year in which this Act becomes effective, and within 180 days of the end of each subsequent year for the next five years, the Office of Legislative Budget Assistant shall calculate the savings to the State of New Hampshire resulting from the repeal of statutes specified in section 2, including any savings resulting from reductions in arrests, incarceration, and supervision.

(b) The savings shall be calculated based on a comparison of the most recent year concluded at the time the calculation is made and the year immediately preceding the year in which this Act became effective.

(2) In making the calculations set forth in this section, the Office of Legislative Budget Assistant shall use actual data. The Office of Legislative Budget Assistant may use best available estimates where actual data is unavailable.

Section 8. Moneys transferred to the Drug War Justice Fund and distributed pursuant to section 4 shall, to the maximum extent consistent with law, be in addition to and not in replacement of any existing allocations or appropriations for the purposes of providing substance use disorder treatment, peer support and recovery services, transitional, supportive, and permanent housing for persons with substance use disorders, and harm reduction interventions.

Section 9. Account Allocation. (1) The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services shall cause the moneys in the Drug War Justice Fund to be distributed as follows:

(a) An amount necessary for administration of section 4 to section 7 not to exceed 4% of the moneys deposited into the Fund in any year.

(b) After the distribution set forth in subsection (1)(a) of this section, the remaining moneys in the Fund shall be distributed to the grants program as set forth in section 4.

Claimants shall be able to appeal any denials and be offered a second chance to prove their claim's validity.

Section 11. Audits. (1) No later than December 31, 2022, and at least once every two years thereafter until the end of the Drug War Justice Fund's five year term, the Office of Legislative Budget Assistant, Audit Division shall conduct financial and performance audits regarding the Drug War Justice Fund and the effectiveness of the Fund in achieving the purposes of the Fund and the policy objectives of this Act.
